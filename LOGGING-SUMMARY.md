## How Logging Works

### Prefix System
All logs use a bracketed prefix to identify their source:
- `[Channel]` - Channel component
- `[DirectMessage]` - Direct message component
- `[Index]` - Main index/routing component
- `[RealtimeManager]` - Realtime service
- `[usePresence]` - Presence hook
- `[usePresenceUpdater]` - Presence updater hook
- `[useCall]` - Call hook
- `[useTypingIndicator]` - Typing indicator hook

### Call Counter System
Functions that could potentially loop have call counters:
```javascript
const callCountRef = useRef({ 
  loadMessages: 0, 
  loadReactions: 0, 
  loadThreadCounts: 0 
});
```

When a function is called:
1. Counter increments
2. Current count is logged
3. If count exceeds threshold (usually 10), a warning is logged with stack trace

Example:
```javascript
callCountRef.current.loadMessages++;
console.log('[Channel] loadMessages called, count:', callCountRef.current.loadMessages);

if (callCountRef.current.loadMessages > 10) {
  console.error('[Channel] ⚠️ INFINITE LOOP DETECTED: loadMessages called more than 10 times!');
  console.trace('[Channel] Stack trace:');
}
```

### Stack Traces
When infinite loops are detected, `console.trace()` automatically provides the call stack to help identify the source.

## How to Use

### 1. Development Mode
Run your app normally and open the browser console. You'll see a detailed log of every operation:

```
[Index] Component rendering
[Index] Initializing presence updater
[usePresenceUpdater] Hook initialized
[Index] Checking auth and setting up auth listener
[Index] checkAuth started
[Index] User authenticated, current path: /channel/123
[Channel] Component rendering, channelId: 123
[Channel] Main useEffect triggered, channelId: 123
[Channel] initChannel started for channelId: 123
...
```

### 2. Filter Specific Components
Use the browser console filter to focus on specific areas:
- Type `[Channel]` to see only channel logs
- Type `⚠️` to see only warnings
- Type `INFINITE LOOP` to see only loop detections

### 3. Monitor Call Counts
Watch for patterns like:
```
[Channel] loadMessages called, count: 1
[Channel] loadMessages called, count: 2
[Channel] loadMessages called, count: 3
```

If the count increases rapidly without user interaction, investigate why.

### 4. Track Execution Flow
Follow the numbered steps in initialization:
```
[Channel] Step 1: joinChannel
[Channel] Step 2: loadChannel
[Channel] Step 3: loadMessages
[Channel] Step 4: getCurrentUser
[Channel] Step 5: loadChannelMembers
[Channel] Step 6: checkAdminStatus
[Channel] initChannel completed successfully
```

If initialization stops at a particular step, that's where the error occurred.

### 5. Check Realtime Subscriptions
Every subscription creation and cleanup is logged:
```
[Channel] Setting up realtime subscription for messages-123
...
[Channel] Cleanup: Unsubscribing from all channels for channelId: 123
```

Subscriptions should be created once and cleaned up on unmount. If you see multiple "Setting up" logs without corresponding "Cleanup" logs, there's a subscription leak.

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Finding Infinite Message Loading
1. Open console and filter by `[Channel]`
2. Look for `loadMessages called, count: X`
3. If X > 10, you'll see: `⚠️ INFINITE LOOP DETECTED`
4. Check the stack trace to see what triggered it
5. Look at the previous logs to understand the sequence

### Scenario 2: Debugging Presence Issues
1. Filter console by `[usePresence]` or `[usePresenceUpdater]`
2. Check how often presence is being updated
3. Verify it's not updating more than once per minute during idle
4. Check for activity handlers triggering too frequently

### Scenario 3: Tracking Down Realtime Problems
1. Filter by `[RealtimeManager]`
2. Check connection state changes
3. Look for reconnection attempts
4. Verify subscriptions are being created and cleaned up properly

### Scenario 4: Understanding Component Re-renders
1. Look for `Component rendering` logs
2. Count how many times components render
3. If excessive, check what's changing in props/state
4. Use React DevTools Profiler alongside these logs

## Performance Impact

The logging system is designed to have minimal performance impact:

- ✅ Simple string concatenation (fast)
- ✅ Conditional checks before expensive operations
- ✅ Stack traces only on errors
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Can be disabled in production by adding a global flag

To disable in production, add at the top of your main file:
```javascript
if (import.meta.env.PROD) {
  console.log = () => {};
  console.error = () => {};
  console.trace = () => {};
}
```

## Limitations

1. **Call counters don't reset**: They persist until page reload. This is intentional to catch cumulative issues.

2. **No time-based tracking**: Logs don't include durations. Use browser DevTools Performance tab for that.

3. **Console only**: Logs aren't sent to a server. For production monitoring, integrate with a service like Sentry or LogRocket.

4. **Stack traces on threshold**: Only appears when limits are exceeded, not on every call.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Logs are now active - run the app
2. ⏭️ Watch console during normal usage
3. ⏭️ Trigger known problematic flows
4. ⏭️ Document any infinite loops found
5. ⏭️ Fix issues based on stack traces

### Future Improvements
- Add performance timing for slow operations
- Add log level control (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Integrate with error tracking service
- Add log aggregation for production
- Create automated tests based on log patterns

## Troubleshooting the Logging Itself

### If logs aren't appearing:
1. Check browser console is open
2. Verify "Preserve log" is enabled
3. Clear filters
4. Refresh page
5. Check console settings (F12 → Settings → Console)

### If too many logs:
1. Use console filters aggressively
2. Temporarily comment out verbose hooks
3. Focus on one component at a time
4. Use browser's search feature (Ctrl+F)

### If you need more detail:
1. Add additional logs to specific functions
2. Log state values before/after changes
3. Add timestamps: `console.log(new Date().toISOString(), '[Channel]', ...)`
4. Use `console.table()` for objects

## Success Metrics

After implementing these logs, you should be able to:
- ✅ Identify the exact function causing infinite loops
- ✅ Understand the sequence of events leading to errors
- ✅ Track down why components re-render excessively
- ✅ Debug realtime subscription issues
- ✅ Verify initialization completes successfully
- ✅ Monitor application health during development
